				<p>Conventional pets, dogs and cats, generally fit the Commentary’s definition.
					These pets represent many types of owners, including those keeping show animals, highly bonded owners, and people simply feeding their animals without
					other interaction (Serpell 1996). Exotic small pets are kept by a growing number of people, including parrots and other birds, as well as fish and reptiles.
					Birds were discussed in the Commentary, as examples of non-domesticated
					animals treated as pets.</p>
				<p>These animals all would fit within the broader definitions offered by Webster’s New Twentieth and The New Shorter Oxford.
					Overlooked in the Commentary are working partners, including horses, camels, and elephants, that provide transport or carry loads and fill a
					role as companions that may include strong attachment.</p>
				<p>Reproduction is
					managed in horses, with selection for behavioral traits, including racing
					ability. Camels, being fully domesticated, are only bred in captivity (except
					for some feral animals); no apparent selection occurs for behavioral traits
					(Gauthier-Pilters and Dagg 1981). Asian elephants live close within human
					society, but generally breed without human management; domesticated
					females are bred by wild bulls (Hart and Sundar 2000).</p>
				<p>The complex range of relationships with pets is easily seen with working
					animals that share companionship with the handler. One question that arises is whether working animals perform better, or not as well, when they also
					are pets (companion animals).</p>
